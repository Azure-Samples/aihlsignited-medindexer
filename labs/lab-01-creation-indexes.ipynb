    "## Define Field Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Understanding Field Types in Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure Cognitive Search, the structure and behavior of an index are defined using various field types, each tailored for specific use cases. These field types are `SearchField`, `SimpleField`, `SearchableField`, and `ComplexField`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SearchField**: This is the foundational field type for defining an index's schema. It encompasses a broad range of attributes that specify the field's role and behavior in the index. Key attributes include:\n",
    "  - `name` and `type`: Define the field's identifier and data type.\n",
    "  - `key`: Indicates if the field is a unique identifier for documents.\n",
    "  - `searchable`: Specifies if the field undergoes full-text search analysis.\n",
    "  - `filterable`, `sortable`, `facetable`: Determine how the field interacts with search queries.\n",
    "  - Analyzers (`analyzer_name`, `search_analyzer_name`, `index_analyzer_name`): Configure text analysis for the field.\n",
    "  - Advanced search attributes like `vector_search_dimensions` and `synonym_map_names`.\n",
    "  - `fields`: For complex types, defining nested sub-fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **SimpleField**: A streamlined version of `SearchField`, designed for fields that don't require full-text search or advanced text analysis. It's typically used for non-textual data like identifiers and metadata, supporting attributes like `key`, `filterable`, `sortable`, and `facetable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SearchableField**: Tailored for fields that require full-text search capabilities, this type includes most of the attributes of `SearchField`. It's particularly suitable for fields with textual content that needs to be searchable, like titles, descriptions, or full text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ComplexField**: Designed for fields that contain nested data structures, `ComplexField` allows you to define a field with sub-fields. It's characterized by:\n",
    "  - `name`: The unique identifier for the field.\n",
    "  - `collection`: A boolean indicating if the field is a collection of complex objects.\n",
    "  - `fields`: A list of sub-fields, which can be of any field type, including nested `ComplexField`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use These Field Types 🛠️\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating Simple and Searchable Fields**: Use `SimpleField` for basic data types and `SearchableField` for text-heavy fields requiring search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Designing Complex Data Structures**: Utilize `ComplexField` to model hierarchical or nested data within your index, defining each level of the hierarchy with appropriate sub-fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimizing Search Behavior**: Leverage `SearchField` for granular control over search behavior, including the use of analyzers and advanced search features like vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Full-text search analyzes and searches through all text within documents, considering language nuances and relevance. Non-full-text search, on the other hand, looks for exact matches or range queries in specific fields or attributes."

    "## Configuring Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring vector search in Azure AI Search involves setting up algorithms and profiles to handle vector-based queries. These are particularly useful for semantic search scenarios, such as finding similar items based on vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration consists of two main components: algorithm configurations and vector search profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HnswAlgorithmConfiguration**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is a high-performance, memory-efficient algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. It creates a multi-layer graph structure that enables fast search for nearest neighbors in high-dimensional data. The configuration includes:\n",
    "   - `name`: A unique identifier for this configuration.\n",
    "   - `kind`: Specifies the algorithm type, in this case, it's HNSW.\n",
    "   - `parameters`: These are key settings that allow you to customize HNSW's behavior for optimal performance and accuracy. They include `m`, `ef_construction`, `ef_search`, and `metric`.\n",
    "     - `m`: Controls the degree of the graph, affecting both search speed and accuracy.\n",
    "     - `ef_construction`: Influences the index construction time and quality.\n",
    "     - `ef_search`: Determines the trade-off between search time and accuracy.\n",
    "   - `metric`: Specifies the distance function used for measuring vector similarity, such as \"cosine\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ExhaustiveKnnAlgorithmConfiguration**: This is a brute-force search algorithm that examines the entire vector index, used during querying. It's slower but can be more accurate for certain use cases. Similar to HNSW, it has `name`, `kind`, and `metric`. However, it lacks the additional tuning parameters found in HNSW.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning HNSW Parameters for Optimal Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Striking the Right Balance between Recall, Latency, and Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The HNSW algorithm parameters can be adjusted to optimize the performance of your vector search. Here are some strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase 'ef_search'**: This can improve recall without needing to reindex. However, monitor your system for potential latency increases. If increasing 'ef_search' isn't effective or causes high latency, consider the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reindex with higher values of ‘m' and/or 'ef_construction'**: This can improve the quality of the search. However, keep in mind that increasing 'ef_construction' may result in longer indexing latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase the ‘m' value**: This should be done carefully and only if other parameters don't sufficiently improve recall after trying the previous steps. Increasing 'm' can improve the quality of the HNSW graph, but it may also increase the memory usage and indexing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, tuning these parameters involves a trade-off between recall and latency. It's important to test different configurations and monitor their impact on your system's performance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector Search Profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "These profiles allow you to define combinations of algorithm configurations for different search scenarios. Each profile, like `myHnswProfile` or `myExhaustiveKnnProfile`, is linked to an algorithm configuration via `algorithm_configuration_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have a profile `fastSearchProfile` linked to an HNSW configuration for general queries where speed is essential, and another profile `accurateSearchProfile` linked to an exhaustive KNN configuration for scenarios where precision is paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fastSearchProfile = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"fastSearchProfile\",\n",
    "    \"algorithm_configuration_name\": \"myHnswConfiguration\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "accurateSearchProfile = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"accurateSearchProfile\",\n",
    "    \"algorithm_configuration_name\": \"myExhaustiveKnnConfiguration\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Configure Vector Search This Way?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Flexibility**: Having different algorithms and profiles lets you tailor your search strategy to specific needs. For example, use HNSW for general queries where speed is essential and exhaustive KNN for scenarios where precision is paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tunable Performance**: HNSW algorithm parameters can be adjusted to find the right balance between speed and accuracy, making it adaptable to various datasets and search requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-offs**: Exhaustive KNN offers high accuracy at the cost of speed and is suitable for scenarios where search completeness is critical."

    "In this configuration, we are enabling semantic search for the Policy Knowledge Store, which means Azure AI Search will try to understand the meaning behind search queries instead of just looking for exact keyword matches. To do that well, we need to tell the system which parts of our indexed data are most important for understanding what each policy is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining the policy_name as the title_field. This is the human-readable name of the policy (like “Type 2 Diabetes Coverage Policy”), and it will appear as the title in the search results. Titles help Azure summarize and highlight results more naturally, giving users quick insight into what each result is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define payer_name, medical_specialties, and drug_names as keywords_fields. These fields act like tags or key concepts. If someone searches for “oncology drugs covered by Cigna,” these keyword fields help the system focus on relevant content because it knows which policies mention “oncology,” “Cigna,” or certain drugs. These fields guide the AI to understand the overall theme of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use chunk as the content_field. This is where the real content of the policy lives—split into smaller pieces or paragraphs. This is what the semantic engine will actually read and compare against the user’s query to decide if it’s a good match. By pointing to chunk, we ensure the model looks at the right level of detail—without being overwhelmed by the entire document."
