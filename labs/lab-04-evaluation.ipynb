    "## Understanding Quantitative Measures of Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our search system, we use several metrics that measure the relevance of the results it returns. These metrics help us understand how well our system is performing and guide us in tuning it for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **NDCG@10**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10 (NDCG@10) is a metric that assesses the effectiveness of a retrieval system at finding and correctly ordering the top 10 documents. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating that the system's ordered list of documents closely matches the ideal order. This metric is widely used because it balances the need for precision (returning relevant results) with the need for proper sequencing (ordering the results correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NDCG@3**: NDCG@3 is similar to NDCG@10, but it focuses on the top 3 documents. This metric is particularly relevant in contexts where it's crucial to have the highest accuracy in the topmost results, such as in generative AI applications. NDCG@3 measures the system's ability to identify and correctly rank the three most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Recall@50**: Recall@50 measures the proportion of high-quality documents identified within the top 50 results. It's calculated by counting the number of documents rated as high quality by a scoring prompt and dividing this by the total number of known good documents for a given query. This metric is useful for assessing the system's ability to retrieve a broad set of relevant documents from a large pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the evaluation process, we use supervised tuning techniques. These techniques involve training a model on a labeled dataset, where the labels indicate the relevance of the documents to the queries. The model learns to predict the relevance of a document to a query, and we can then use these predictions to calculate the metrics above. This allows us to measure the relevance of our queries in an automated and scalable way."

    "## Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the qualitative performance of our search store in alignment with the BEIR framework, we follow a three-step process to generate our evaluation dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corpus Creation:**\n",
    "   We begin by extracting document chunks from our Azure Search index. These chunks are consolidated into a corpus file (`corpus.jsonl`), ensuring that the foundational set of documents is standardized and comprehensive for subsequent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Generation:**\n",
    "   Next, we utilize GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of queries based on five carefully selected diagnosis and medication scenarios from our medical index. This targeted approach ensures that the queries are medically relevant and reflective of real-world clinical information needs. The generated queries are stored in `queries.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relevance Judgments:**\n",
    "   Finally, we employ an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the relevance of the documents with respect to each query. This evaluation produces relevance judgments that are saved in `qrel.jsonl`. These qrels form the basis for computing our performance metrics, including NDCG@10, NDCG@3, and Recall@50.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the below cells to generate your own dataset, please uncomment the code and run it. The dataset will be saved in the `evals/benchmark/medindexer` directory, where our existing datasets have been curated.\n"

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.

Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nPrior authorization requirements for Adalimumab in inflammatory bowel disease\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq3\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.

This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.

Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. .

A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\\\\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\\\\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\\\\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .\",\\n    \"id\": \"d22\",\\n    \"title\": \"001.pdf\",\\n    \"chunk_id\": \"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n#### QUERY:\\n\\nCrohn\\'s Adalimumab medication authorization guidelines\\n\\n#### QUERY ID:\\n\\nq7\\n\\n# Tasks\\n## Please provide your assessment Score for the CORPUS entries in relation to the QUERY based on the Definitions above.
