    "## Understanding Quantitative Measures of Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our search system, we use several metrics that measure the relevance of the results it returns. These metrics help us understand how well our system is performing and guide us in tuning it for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **NDCG@10**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10 (NDCG@10) is a metric that assesses the effectiveness of a retrieval system at finding and correctly ordering the top 10 documents. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating that the system's ordered list of documents closely matches the ideal order. This metric is widely used because it balances the need for precision (returning relevant results) with the need for proper sequencing (ordering the results correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NDCG@3**: NDCG@3 is similar to NDCG@10, but it focuses on the top 3 documents. This metric is particularly relevant in contexts where it's crucial to have the highest accuracy in the topmost results, such as in generative AI applications. NDCG@3 measures the system's ability to identify and correctly rank the three most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Recall@50**: Recall@50 measures the proportion of high-quality documents identified within the top 50 results. It's calculated by counting the number of documents rated as high quality by a scoring prompt and dividing this by the total number of known good documents for a given query. This metric is useful for assessing the system's ability to retrieve a broad set of relevant documents from a large pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the evaluation process, we use supervised tuning techniques. These techniques involve training a model on a labeled dataset, where the labels indicate the relevance of the documents to the queries. The model learns to predict the relevance of a document to a query, and we can then use these predictions to calculate the metrics above. This allows us to measure the relevance of our queries in an automated and scalable way."

    "## Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the qualitative performance of our search store in alignment with the BEIR framework, we follow a three-step process to generate our evaluation dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corpus Creation:**\n",
    "   We begin by extracting document chunks from our Azure Search index. These chunks are consolidated into a corpus file (`corpus.jsonl`), ensuring that the foundational set of documents is standardized and comprehensive for subsequent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Generation:**\n",
    "   Next, we utilize GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of queries based on five carefully selected diagnosis and medication scenarios from our medical index. This targeted approach ensures that the queries are medically relevant and reflective of real-world clinical information needs. The generated queries are stored in `queries.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relevance Judgments:**\n",
    "   Finally, we employ an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the relevance of the documents with respect to each query. This evaluation produces relevance judgments that are saved in `qrel.jsonl`. These qrels form the basis for computing our performance metrics, including NDCG@10, NDCG@3, and Recall@50.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the below cells to generate your own dataset, please uncomment the code and run it. The dataset will be saved in the `evals/benchmark/medindexer` directory, where our existing datasets have been curated.\n"
