    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have provisioned your Azure resources, configured your environment variables (Search endpoint, key, and index name), and set up a Conda environment to manage dependencies. Refer to [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for full setup instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through **two approaches for indexing policy documents stored in Azure Blob Storage**, using either the **Push SDK** or the **native Azure AI Search Indexer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. [**Indexing Policy Documents from Blob Storage Using the SDK (Push Model)**](#index-using-push-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we build a fully controlled indexing pipeline using the Azure SDK for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load PDF or text-based policy documents directly from Blob Storage\n",
    "- Preprocess and chunk content for retrieval\n",
    "- Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI\n",
    "- Upload documents, metadata, and vector embeddings into Azure AI Search using the `SearchClient`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method gives you **maximum flexibility** and is ideal when you need to integrate your own preprocessing logic, custom chunking strategies, or real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. [**Indexing Policy Documents Using Azure AI Search Indexers with Custom Skillsets**](#index-using-indexer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses the built-in **Azure Search Indexer** to automatically crawl documents from Blob Storage and enrich them using a **custom skillset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect Blob Storage as a data source\n",
    "- Define a skillset that performs OCR, embedding, or text extraction\n",
    "- Automatically map enriched fields into your Azure Search index\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is best when you want to **automate the ingestion pipeline** with minimal custom code, leveraging Azure's low-code enrichment platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By the end of this notebook, you’ll understand how to build both a **fully customized ingestion flow** using the SDK and a **scalable low-code pipeline** using native indexers with skillsets — both optimized for retrieving policy content stored in Blob Storage.\n"

In those who are secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is\\nrecommended over switching out of the class.  \\n· Crohn\\'s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has guidelines\\nfor Crohn\\'s disease (2018).4 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is resistant\\nto corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing disease, and\\nmaintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn\\'s disease, a TNFi should be\\nstarted within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence. Guidelines from the\\nAmerican Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis among the\\ntherapies for moderate to severe Crohn\\'s disease, for induction and maintenance of\\nremission. 17  \\n· Hidradenitis Suppurativa: British guidelines (2018) recommend consideration of\\nadalimumab for those with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to\\nconventional therapy.19  \\n· JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the treatment\\nof JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\\narthritis. For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a trial of a  \\n3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior\\nAuthorization Policy  \\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nconventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids\\nare recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an\\ninadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic ±\\nconventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given\\nthe impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a\\npreferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also\\navailable specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and\\nenthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and\\nenthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g., following\\nDMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis\\nor enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may\\nbe preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of high-\\nrisk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or\\nthose judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage).  \\n· Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and\\nNational Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy\\ntreatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7  \\n· PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in\\ntreatment-naïve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an\\noral therapy.8  \\n· Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a\\nbiologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated\\ndose of methotrexate who is not at target.2  \\n. Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that\\nthe following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely\\nactive disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic\\ncorticosteroids, Entyvio® (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz®/XR (tofacitinib\\ntablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020)\\nrecommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi.10 In addition to the\\napproved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009)\\nindicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole,\\nciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or\\ntopical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., mesalamine), or\\nimmunosuppressive agents (e.g., infliximab).  \\n. Uveitis and Ocular Inflammatory Disorders: American Academy of\\nOphthalmology (AAO) guidelines (2014) note that adalimumab may be used in\\npatients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy-associated or\\nhuman leukocyte antigen [HLA]-B27-associated uveitis, JIA-associated uveitis, and\\nother posterior uveitides and panuveitis syndromes).12 Adalimumab should be\\nconsidered second-line in vision-threatening JIA-associated uveitis when\\nmethotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong recommendation) and may be\\nused as corticosteroid-sparing treatment for vision-threatening chronic uveitis from\\nseronegative spondyloarthropathy (strong recommendation). Adalimumab may also\\nbe considered in other patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid-\\ndependent disease who have failed first-line therapies. Adalimumab should be\\nconsidered as a second-line immunomodulatory agent for severe ocular inflammatory\\nconditions including chronic and severe scleritis. ACR/Arthritis Federation guidelines\\n(2019) for uveitis associated with JIA make recommendations for use of conventional\\nsystemic DMARDs and biologics. In patients with severe active chronic anterior\\nuveitis associated with sight-threatening complications, a TNFi (monoclonal antibody)\\n\\\\+ methotrexate is recommended.19  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->'),\n",
