## Setting Up Azure AI Services

- **Azure AI search**: Delivering Deliver accurate, hyper-personalized responses in your Gen AI applications [start here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search/)
- **Azure Open AI Services**: To effectively vectorize data, we leverage the embeddings models from Azure OpenAI Services.

## Configuration Environment Variables

Before running this notebook, you must configure certain environment variables. We will now use environment variables to store our configuration. This is a more secure practice as it prevents sensitive data from being accidentally committed and pushed to version control systems.

Create a `.env` file in your project root (use the provided `.env.sample` as a template) and add the following variables:

```env
# Required: Azure AI Search Service Configuration
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY=""
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME_DOCUMENTS=""

# Required: Azure Open API Configuration
AZURE_AOAI_API_KEY=''
AZURE_AOAI_API_ENDPOINT=''
AZURE_AOAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_ID=''
AZURE_AOAI_API_VERSION=''

# Required IF interacting with Blob Storage: Azure Storage Configuration
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=''

# REQUIRED IF APPLYING OCR: Azure Document Intelligence API Configuration
AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY=""
```

Please replace the placeholders in the `.env` file with your actual configurations for Azure Open API, Azure Storage, Microsoft Entra ID, and Azure Document Intelligence API.

- `AZURE_AOAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_AOAI_API_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_AOAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `AZURE_AOAI_API_VERSION`: These are your Azure Open API configurations. You can find these details in your Azure Open API service in the Azure portal.

- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: This is the connection string for your Azure Storage. You can find it in the "Access keys" section of your Storage account in the Azure portal.

- `AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY`: These are your Azure Document Intelligence API configurations. You can find these details in your Azure Document Intelligence service in the Azure portal.

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**
> Remember not to commit the .env file to your version control system. Add it to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked.


## Create Conda Environment from the Repository

> Instructions for Windows users:

1. **Create the Conda Environment**:
   - In your terminal or command line, navigate to the repository directory.
   - Execute the following command to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yaml
     ```
   - This command creates a Conda environment as defined in `environment.yaml`.

2. **Activating the Environment**:
   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment by using:
     ```bash
     conda activate speech-ai-azure-services
     ```

> Instructions for Linux users (or Windows users with WSL or other linux setup):

1. **Use `make` to Create the Conda Environment**:
   - In your terminal or command line, navigate to the repository directory and look at the Makefile.
   - Execute the `make` command specified below to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file:
     ```bash
     make create_conda_env
     ```

2. **Activating the Environment**:
   - After creation, activate the new Conda environment by using:
     ```bash
     conda activate speech-ai-azure-services
     ```

## Configure VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Install Required Extensions**:
   - Download and install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions for VSCode. These extensions provide support for running and editing Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode.

2. **Attach Kernel to VSCode**:
   - After creating the Conda environment, it should be available in the kernel selection dropdown. This dropdown is located in the top-right corner of the VSCode interface.
   - Select your newly created environment (`mediindexer`) from the dropdown. This sets it as the kernel for running your Jupyter Notebooks.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Once the kernel is attached, you can run the notebook by clicking on the "Run All" button in the top menu, or by running each cell individually.

4. **Voila! Ready to Go**:
   - Now that your environment is set up and your kernel is attached, you're ready to go! Please visit the notebooks in the repository to start exploring.

> **Note:** By following these steps, you'll establish a dedicated Conda environment for your project and configure VSCode to run Jupyter Notebooks efficiently. This environment will include all the necessary dependencies specified in your `environment.yaml` file. If you wish to add more packages or change versions, please use `pip install` in a notebook cell or in the terminal after activating the environment, and then restart the kernel. The changes should be automatically applied after the session restarts.
