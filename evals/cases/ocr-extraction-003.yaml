      ground_truth: >-
        V. Dosage and Administration (for B-ALL):
        - For MRD-positive B-ALL:
          • Treatment course: 1 induction cycle followed by up to 3 consolidation cycles.
          • Patients ≥ 45 kg receive a fixed dose:
            - Induction cycle 1: Days 1-28 at 28 mcg/day, followed by a 14-day treatment-free interval.
            - Consolidation cycles 2-4: Days 1-28 at 28 mcg/day with a subsequent 14-day treatment-free interval.
          • Patients < 45 kg are dosed based on body surface area (BSA) with lower starting doses and titration.
        - For relapsed or refractory B-ALL:
          • A modified induction and consolidation regimen is used with similar maximum dose limits of 28 mcg/day.
