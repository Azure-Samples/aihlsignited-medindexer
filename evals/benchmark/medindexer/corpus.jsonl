{"chunk": "Other Uses with Supportive Evidence There are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab products in the following conditions: . Behcet's Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet's disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet's disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with adalimumab products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. .

{"chunk": "conventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .", "id": "d22", "title": "001.pdf", "chunk_id": "4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0"}

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED 1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy. Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g ., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication. 2. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.
