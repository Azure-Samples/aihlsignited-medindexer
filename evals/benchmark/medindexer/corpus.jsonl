{"chunk":"Other Uses with Supportive Evidence There are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab products in the following conditions: . Behcet's Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g ., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet's disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet's disease. 12 Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e ., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective. . Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15 POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products.

{"chunk":"Guidelines/Recommendations Dravet Syndrome At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome: Epidiolex, Diacomit\u00ae (stiripentol capsules, powder for oral suspension), and Fintepla\u00ae (fenfluramine oral solution).1,11,17 An expert panel considers valproic acid and clobazam to be the first-line treatment for Dravet syndrome.4 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit and topiramate are second- line treatment. Ketogenic diet is moderately effective and can also be considered second-line. The Dravet Foundation states that Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla are considered first-line agents for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still inadequate, other therapies to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and zonisamide.2,4 Sodium channel blockers (e.g ., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin) can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. Additionally, vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase the frequency of myoclonic seizures and should be avoided. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Epidiolex, Fintepla, felbamate, Banzel\u00ae (rufinamide tablet, oral suspension), lamotrigine, topiramate, and clobazam.12 Despite the lack of level I or level II evidence, valproic acid remains a mainstay in treatment.8,9,13 If valproic acid does not provide adequate seizure control, which is almost always the case, lamotrigine should be added as the first adjunctive therapy.7 If the combination regimen of valproic acid and lamotrigine does not provide adequate control, then Banzel should be initiated and either valproic acid or lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not achieved, the next adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and felbamate. There is limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and Fycompa\u00ae (perampanel tablet, oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs should be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs raise the risk of side effects and/or drug-drug interactions. POLICY STATEMENT Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Epidiolex. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Epidiolex as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Epidiolex to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. \u00b7 Epidiolex\u00ae (cannabidiol oral solution - Greenwich Biosciences) is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable): FDA-Approved Indications 6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antiseizure Medications - Epidiolex Prior Authorization Policy","chunk_id":"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0","id":"d12","page_number":"3","parent_id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2","parent_path":"https://storageautoauthrtznwpq.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/002.pdf","title":"002.pdf"}

{"chunk":"conventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic + conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g ., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g ., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage). Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7 PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-na\u00efve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8 Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2 Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio\u00ae (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz\u00ae/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g ., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g ., infliximab). .","chunk_id":"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2_normalized_images_2_pages_0","id":"d22","page_number":"3","parent_id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAxLnBkZg2","parent_path":"https://storageautoauthrtznwpq.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/001.pdf","title":"001.pdf"}

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. . . Tuberous sclerosis complex. Disease Overview Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy marked with frequent and/or prolonged seizures.2,3 The seizures generally begin in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals can develop many seizure types: myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence, atypical absence, atonic, focal aware or impaired awareness (previously called partial seizures), and status epilepticus.3 Two or more antiseizure medications (ASMs) are often needed to control the seizures;","chunk_id":"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2_normalized_images_0_pages_0","id":"d28","page_number":"1","parent_id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2","parent_path":"https://storageautoauthrtznwpq.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/002.pdf","title":"002.pdf"}
{"chunk":"most often begins between 3 and 5 years of age.6-9 Affected children experience several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of muscle tone and limpness) and tonic seizures.6,9 The three main forms of treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are ASMs, dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet), and device/surgery (e.g ., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callostomy).9 None of the therapies are effective in all cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the disorder has proven particularly resistant to most therapeutic options. Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare, genetic disease that causes non-cancerous (benign) tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin.10 It can result in a combination of symptoms including seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and kidney disease. Seizures affect most individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex at some point during their life and can be difficult to control. Clinical Efficacy in Other Refractory Seizures In 2014, an expanded access program was initiated to provide Epidiolex to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy.14 Of the 840 patients included in a published review, 192 patients were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and 648 patients were diagnosed with other conditions, including CDKL5 deficiency disorder, Dup15q, Aicardi, and Doose syndromes; febrile infection-related epilepsy syndromes; tuberous sclerosis complex; Sturge-Weber syndrome; lissencephaly; cortical malformation/dysplasia; and myoclonic absence. The patients enrolled in the study had severe, intractable, childhood-onset treatment-resistant epilepsy and were on stable doses of ASMs for 4 weeks before starting Epidiolex as add-on therapy. The initial dose of Epidiolex was 2 to 10 mg/kg/day (taken as two divided doses) and gradually titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day, depending upon treatment site. Of those enrolled in the expanded access program, 892 patients were evaluated and included in the safety analysis set and 840 patients were included in the efficacy analysis set. Through 192 weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency across visit windows ranged from 50% to 67% for convulsive seizures and 46% to 66% for total seizures. In a cohort of 132 patients (72 children, 60 adults) with treatment-resistant epilepsy, bi-weekly seizure frequency decreased from a mean of 144.4 at entry to 52.2 at 12 weeks (P = 0.01) and remained stable thereafter.15 Of note, patients with a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome were initially excluded because of preferential enrollment into the randomized clinical trials; once these trials were closed for enrollment, patients with these syndromes were also enrolled.","chunk_id":"4fa106cdfad7_aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2_normalized_images_1_pages_0","id":"d29","page_number":"2","parent_id":"aHR0cHM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXV0b2F1dGhydHpud3BxLmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9wcmUtYXV0aC1wb2xpY2llcy9wb2xpY2llc19vY3IvMDAyLnBkZg2","parent_path":"https://storageautoauthrtznwpq.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/002.pdf","title":"002.pdf"}

Adalimumab may also be considered in other patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid- dependent disease who have failed first-line therapies.
