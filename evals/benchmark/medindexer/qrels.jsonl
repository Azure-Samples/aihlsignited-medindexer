{"document":"d76","explanation":"The document discusses Afinitor authorization guidelines for a different condition (GIST), not osteosarcoma or Everolimus, making it irrelevant to the query about high-grade osteosarcoma guidelines for Everolimus use.","query":"q35","relevant":0,"relevant_score":1,"thought_chain":"Let's think step by step: The query asks about authorization guidelines for Everolimus in high-grade osteosarcoma. The document discusses authorization for Afinitor in relation to Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) and includes criteria for its use such as presence of certain mutations and past therapies. However, it does not mention Everolimus or high-grade osteosarcoma. Thus, the document's content is not relevant to the query."}
