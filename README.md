# MedIndexer: AI-Powered Clinical Knowledge Base Framework  

> This project is **part of the [HLS Ignited Program](https://github.com/microsoft/aihlsIgnited)**, which focuses on hands-on projects that show how AI is transforming the healthcare industry. In this project, we empower healthcare providers and payor organizations to build **AI-driven clinical knowledge bases** using **Azure AI Search**. Please visit the program page to explore the full program and its projects.

**MedIndexer** is a **indexing framework** designed for the **automated creation of structured knowledge bases** from clinical and policy-related documents. It enables the transformation of **clinical notes and policy documentation** into a **schema-driven, searchable format**, allowing your applications to leverage **state-of-the-art retrieval methodologies**, including **vector search and re-ranking**, seamlessly integrated with **Azure AI Search**. By applying a **well-defined schema** for data organization and vectorizing the data into a **higher-dimensional representation**, MedIndexer empowers AI applications to retrieve **more precise and context-aware information**.

- **Schema-Based Knowledge Structuring**: Converts **clinical and policy documents** into a **schema-driven format**, ensuring structured and efficient retrieval while applying **vectorization techniques** to encode document semantics in high-dimensional space.
- **Seamless Azure AI Search Integration**: Optimized for **scalability, speed, and precision retrieval**, leveraging **vector embeddings, hybrid search, and re-ranking**.
- **Dimensionality Expansion for Advanced Retrieval**: Vectorized indexing transforms text into a **multi-dimensional representation**, enabling **context-aware retrieval, similarity-based ranking, and advanced filtering**.
- **Automated Metadata Extraction**: Dynamically **identifies, enriches, and categorizes** key information from documents, improving **search relevance** and allowing for **faceted filtering**.
- **Structured and Semantic Querying**: Supports **SQL-style filtering** alongside **vector-based semantic retrieval**, bridging **structured and unstructured data retrieval** methodologies.
